# CS279 Tier 1 HW: Svelte and Firebase

This code creates a basic to-do list web app using Svelte and Firebase. In addition to the basic functionality of adding and checking off todos, it also allows users to delete todos entirely.

## Usage

Clone this repository (from the command line or using GitHub Desktop). If from the command line, use the following command:

git clone https://github.com/19katz/svelte-todo-app.git

Once cloned locally, open up the to-do app by running the following commands:
* `npm i firebase`
* `npm run dev`

Then, navigate to the localhost link given on the terminal console. Ensure that Firebase is installed before going to the link, or it will not work.
